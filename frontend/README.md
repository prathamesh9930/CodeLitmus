# Frontend - CodeLitmus UI

This directory contains the frontend user interface files for CodeLitmus.

## Files:
- `index.html` - Main UI with tabbed interface
- `styles.css` - Complete styling for the application  
- `script.js` - JavaScript for frontend functionality

## Usage:
You can open `index.html` directly in a browser, but for full functionality you need the backend API running.

## API Configuration:
The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

To change this, edit the `API_BASE_URL` variable in `script.js`
