# 🌐 Frontend Directory (Legacy Reference)

> **⚠️ Important**: This directory previously contained standalone frontend files that have been **removed during code cleanup**. The current CodeLitmus application uses an integrated backend with templates located in `backend/templates/` for the modern interface.

##  Current Implementation

The **active frontend** is now integrated with the FastAPI backend:
- **Location**: `backend/templates/index.html`
- **Features**: Modern UI with animations, dark mode, PDF generation
- **Styling**: Enhanced CSS with glassmorphism effects in `backend/static/style.css`
- **Functionality**: Drag & drop, progress bars, hover animations

## � Legacy Files Removed

The following files were removed during code cleanup to eliminate redundancy:
- ❌ `index.html` - Original tabbed interface (redundant)
- ❌ `styles.css` - Basic styling (outdated)
- ❌ `script.js` - Frontend functionality (superseded)

## 🎯 Why These Files Were Removed

1. **Redundancy**: Functionality already exists in the integrated backend
2. **Outdated**: Legacy files lacked modern features
3. **Maintenance**: Single source of truth reduces complexity
4. **Performance**: Integrated approach is more efficient

## 🔗 For Development

To work with the frontend:
1. Navigate to `backend/templates/index.html` for the main interface
2. Edit styles in `backend/static/style.css`
3. Run the server from the root directory: `start_server.bat`

## 📂 Directory Purpose

This directory now serves as:
- Documentation reference for the legacy approach
- Historical context for the project evolution
- Migration notes for future reference

**Recommendation**: Use the integrated backend application at `backend/` which includes the modern, feature-rich interface.
